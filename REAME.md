# Introduction to web development
Welcome to a journey! The purpose of this course is to give you inspiration and
knowledge of web development, one of the skills in most demand on the swedish
labor market. We want to empower you to realize ideas, demystify the
technologies, make you see what is possible to do on your own and also how
simple and fun it can be to program. This course will not be sufficient for
employment but enough to be a stepping stone for you into a career in web
development. We will also provide you with free online resources to continue
learning on your own, after the course has ended. The course is free of charge
and enabled through the Swedish Red cross.
### Prerequisites
The course will be given in english so sufficient communication skills in
english is necessary. In order to keep up with the pace of the course it is also
necessary to have basic computer skills, and know how to navigate the web to
find information. No previous experience with programming or web development is
necessary. The school will provide you with computers to work with during the
course.
### Course content
In the beginning of the course we will give you an overview of basic concepts on
how the internet works, and specifically how web browsers and servers
communicate. We will go through the technologies that makes a website, such as
html, css and javascript. We will combine theory with practice and you will
learn how to work with these technologies. During the course you will work with
4 major projects, that will give you an understanding of what web development is
and help you proceed learning more on your own. At the end of the course we will
hopefully make a visit to a company working with web development to see how
professionals work.

### Projects
===

##### PROJECT 1: Build a Personal website
You will develop a website that will display images, descriptions and links. In
this project we will focus on learning html and css, and handling the graphical
layout of a web page.

##### PROJECT 2: Add interactivity to website
You will add interactivity to the website you made in the first project so that
certain effects such as sliding-effects or popup-effects happens when a user
interacts with the content. In this project we will focus on learning jQuery, a
JavaScript library, that makes creating these effects easy.

##### PROJECT 3: Build a game
You will develop a simple snake game that runs in the browser. In this project
we will focus on learning JavaScript and some more advanced programming
techniques and concepts.

##### PROJECT 4: Build a To-Do application
In this project we will build a simple “To-Do list” application that connects to
a database and stores “To-do items”. This means that you will be able to start
the application at another time and see the same “To-Do” items that you stored
from your previous session. In this project we will use Meteor, a javascript
framework.

### Group size and teaching methodology
Maximum 12 students. The course extends over 10 weeks and takes place twice a
week, of which one is a 3 hour lecture by a student from Chalmers University,
and the second occasion is for practical exercise and for you to work with the
projects under supervision. Apart from classes and exercise sessions we expect
the students to work with the projects approximately 8 hours a week outside of
the classroom.
